## Project Overview

> If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** Qlone AI
- **Brief Description:** With the leverage of AI & Blockchain, Qlone's infrastructure is aiming to provide an all-in-one solution to generate your smart-digital AR clone. A new seamless approach on how to simulate, train, personalize, and manage AI on the blockchain.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** EOS is one of the best blockchains for our team due to its high level of security and decentralization, fast transactions & low gas fees, and can't forget about enabled smart contracts. Last but not least, EOS is EVM compatible, which makes it easy to port solidity code because we are familiar with it.
- **Reason for Interest:** An AI NFT generator is a really demanding tool for any blockchain. EOS ecosystem could be one of the first blockchain to integrate AI into WEB3 with the help of our team. AI cloning tools, generators are useful tools for many businesses and people. We have multiple AI models prepared to merge. Our application will be the first one to offer many AI features that are not available on mobile. To add, our AI models will be available in one infrastructure which will give seamless access to users with no need to transfer through other platforms. 

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components https://docsend.com/view/8qrh7ugx864p2pi3
- Data models of the core functionality / API specifications of the core functionality

Communication between UI and backend developed in Representational State Transfer (REST) standart. Authentification based on bearer tokens.
Image to image model training based also on Representational State Transfer (REST) standart communicates with cloud based stable diffusion service.
Voice cloning based on openAI open-sourcing a neural net Whisper and managed in REST API,
Text to speech based on Azure text-to-speech service and maanaged on REST API

- An overview of the technology stack to be used


Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
Large Language Models (LoRA)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
GPT-4 natural language AI model
Machine learning
Solidity
Java Script
Python

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
https://github.com/QLONEAI
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
We have a functional app prototype, and multiple AI models and blockchain integrations are already available.
The development team managed to generate our own GAN, RNN AI model prototypes which will be more cost-effective for future sales.

- What your project is not or will not provide or implement
- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

The project will not develop all AI Models on its own in the first stages of the product, we will use some already polished 3rd party AI models. Such as Stable Diffusion, and Microsoft.

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOS Network landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

AI NFT generator is really demanding tool for any blockchain. EOS ecosystem could be one of the first blockchain to integrate AI into WEB3 with the help of our team. AI cloning tolls, and generators are useful tools for many businesses and people, we have multiple AI models prepared to merge. Our application will be the first one to offer many AI features that are not available on mobile. In add, our AI models will be available in one infrastructure which will give seamless access to users with no need to transfer through other platforms. 
EOS is one of the best blockchain for our team due to high level of security and decentralization, fast transactions & low gas fees, and can't forget about enabled smart contracts. Last but not least, EOS is EVM compatible, which makes it easy to port solidity code because we are familiar with it.

- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Games/Gaming studios, Content/Collection creators, AI users/developers, Customer service, and more...

- What need(s) does your project meet?

The current AI market offers limited and non-realistic 2D and 3D avatars, lacking interactivity and personalization using biometric data. Speech avatars cannot be tailored to specific needs, and lack identification. Generating NFT collections is a complex and time-consuming process that requires hiring multiple experts. There is room for improvement in the AI market to create more engaging and personalized experiences.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different? NO
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

Within the scope of the blockchain and AI industries, Qlone does not face any direct competition from other brands. We provide our customers with seamless access to a number of features that are not available in other products. Competitor prices are high also we can compete with our tools which they lack, we can compete with our price and technology options. Simillar projects: Fetch.AI, Alethea.AI, Bicasso.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

>⚡ If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

## Future Plans

We will acquire users with our growth model for 1 year, we will offer better pricing with our tools which other projects lack. Our strategy is user acquisition using our marketing plan and go-to-market strategy. We will focus on user acquisition and revenue for first year. Marketing plan: Affiliate marketing, referral systems, ad words, seo, smm (social media marketing twitter, instagram, tiktok and etc..), Kols (influencers), partnership promotions.
Another important marketing milestone is token IDO through numerous launchpads which will give instant token/NFT holders and users. We have great connections with numerous tier 1 launchpads.
